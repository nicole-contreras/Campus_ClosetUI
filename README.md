# APPSMITH

We have three pages:
  One for the Buyer. The buyer can view all of the items listed on the app.
  They can click through the table to see any previous conversations they might've had.
  They can start a conversation or follow up with the seller

  The seller: The Sellers are able list the items in which they can put the category of the type of clothing they are buying, the price of the item, and the size of item and submit that to make changes, which can be seen in the code. You are able to converse with the buyer about what theyâ€™re selling and negotiate prices. Sellers are able to edit and disdcard list items which show the items that have been sold and therefore are discarded from their list of clothes that are shown to the buyers.

  The admin has access to all of the ratings posted on the entire Closet Campus. They have the4 ability to take down any ratings.
  They also have a list of all the admins on the system
